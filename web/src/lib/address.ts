// A real address, in a backend that only stores a string.
//
// `location` is a single free-text field on both events and bookings — there is
// no line1/city/state/zip anywhere in the API. So the pieces are collected
// separately, composed into one canonical string on the way out, and parsed
// back out of it on the way in. The round trip is lossless for anything this
// app wrote; for a value typed before this existed (or by iOS, which still
// writes free text) the parser recovers what it can and leaves the rest in
// line 1, which is the honest place for text it can't identify.
//
// Only the event's address is collected this way. A booking inherits its
// location from the event or, for a venue, from the venue's own listing.
