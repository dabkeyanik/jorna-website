// The old control was a city autocomplete over lib/cities that accepted any
// free text, so "Chicagoo", "tbd" and "" were all equally valid answers and a
// vendor could be sent to any of them. These are the parts of a US address, the
// state is a picker so it can't be misspelt, and the zip is checked for shape.
//
// The backend has no address columns, so the caller composes these into the one
// `location` string it does have — see lib/address.
//
// Four of the five fields are facts about the fifth: a ZIP determines its city
// and state. lib/zips ships that table, so typing a ZIP fills them in and a ZIP
// that contradicts them says so — which is where the real mistakes are. The
// street line is the part people know by heart, and stays typed.
