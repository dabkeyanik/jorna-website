# For staging and PR-preview builds, run from apps/<app> after `npm run build`:
#   1. Points public/_redirects at the staging apps instead of production. The
#      client app sends old vendor URLs (/app/my-dashboard, …) to the vendor
#      app on jornaevents.com; on staging that sent people to production. The
#      rewritten rules use 302, so a browser doesn't cache a staging redirect
#      the way it caches a 301.
#   2. Fails if a production web or API address is still anywhere in the
#      built site, except canonical/og:url tags (metadata for search engines,
#      never followed by the browser) and _headers (the committed CSP; staging
#      builds only add to it). The cross-app links come from
#      NEXT_PUBLIC_VENDOR_APP_URL / NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_APP_URL, which the
#      build must have set.
