# @jorna/shared

Code both web apps use, identical on both sides: the API client and token
refresh, push, Sentry, pricing and address helpers, the UI kit, and the
brand styles. Each app imports it as source —

```ts
import { apiFetch } from "@jorna/shared/lib/api";
import { Button } from "@jorna/shared/components/ui";
import "@jorna/shared/styles/globals.css";
```

— and Next compiles it with the app (Turbopack builds workspace packages
automatically), so there's no build step here.

It also holds the contract and negotiation code the client app will need
for signing in its own app (plan phase 4): the contract's types
(`lib/contractTypes`), the draft model (`lib/contractDraft`), the comparison
(`lib/contractDiff`), the negotiation value model (`lib/negotiation`), and
`components/negotiation/` (`ContractPaper`, `ContractCompare`,
`NegotiationWorkspace`). These read only the fields they declare
(`PackageSource`, `RequestSource`, `ContractTermsSource`, …), so either app's
wider types fit. The wrappers that call the API (`VendorNegotiation`,
`ClientNegotiation`) stay in the vendor app.

Change something here and both apps get it. What isn't here yet — the
typed API layer (`lib/jorna.ts`), most of `lib/types.ts`, auth and the
components built on them — has drifted apart between the apps and is being
reconciled before it moves.

```bash
npm --workspace @jorna/shared run lint
npm --workspace @jorna/shared run typecheck
npm --workspace @jorna/shared run test
